* Are they openly accessible? 
* What restrictions might we encounter: copyright, licensing, format, cleanliness, 
* What ethical considerations might ensue? Is IRB sufficient or are there additional considerations?

## [Humanities Data in the Library: Integrity, Form, Access by Thomas Padilla](http://www.dlib.org/dlib/march16/padilla/03padilla.html)

Where traditional library objects like books, images, and audio clips begin to be explored as data, new considerations of integrity, form, and access come to the fore. **Integrity** refers to the documentation practices that ensure data are amenable to critical evaluation. **Form** refers to the formats and data structures that contain data users need to engage in a common set of activities. **Access** refers to technologies used to make data available for use.

* Posner: to what extent is information about Humanities data collection provenance, processing, and method of presentation available to the user?
* Stodden: to what extent are data and the code that generates data available to the user?
* Risam: to what extent are the motivations driving all of the above available to the user?
