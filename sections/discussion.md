# Data in the humanities 


## When we discuss using data in humanities research, what questions do we need to ask about our data sets?
* Do those sets even exist? 
* Are they openly accessible? 
* What restrictions might we encounter: copyright, licensing, format, cleanliness, 
* What ethical considerations might ensue? Is IRB sufficient or are there additional considerations?
* What does it mean to use data collected for one purpose for another purpose? What is left out? What humanities questions can you ask? 
    *  Big Data, Medium Data, Small Data, Curated data, Clean data

* Where traditional library objects like books, images, and audio clips begin to be explored as data, new considerations of integrity, form, and access come to the fore. **Integrity** refers to the documentation practices that ensure data are amenable to critical evaluation. **Form** refers to the formats and data structures that contain data users need to engage in a common set of activities. **Access** refers to technologies used to make data available for use.
    * To what extent is information about Humanities data collection provenance, processing, and method of presentation available to the user? (Posner) 
    * To what extent are data and the code that generates data available to the user? (Stodden)
    * To what extent are the motivations driving all of the above available to the user? (Risam)
